# RabbitMQ HTTP API Client for Go

## Supported RabbitMQ Versions

All versions require [RabbitMQ Management UI plugin](http://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) to be installed and enabled.


## Project Maturity

Rabbit Hole is a **very immature** project and breaking changes are quite likely.
It also completely lacks documentation and at the moment likely isn't useful to
anyone but the author.
